Enlighten jQuery Plugin

This jQuery plugin allows the user to add a systematic lightening or darkening effect to the background color of row like 
structures in HTML (repetitive tr's, li's, div's, etc.).

For a long time as developers, we have performed a light/dark row background for tabuar data using the modulo operator.  Creating an
every-other light dark effect.

I recently read an article that mentioned the optimum color change is every 3 rows.  That gave me the idea to create a plugin that
allows the user to specify the row interval - every 2, 3, 5, up to 'n'.
